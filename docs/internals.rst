Distlib's design
================

This is the section containing some discussion of how ``distlib``'s design was
arrived at, as and when time permits.

The ``locators`` API
--------------------

This section describes the design of the ``distlib`` API relating to accessing
distribution metadata, whether stored locally or in indexes like PyPI.

The problem we're trying to solve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

People who use distributions need to locate, download and install them.
Distributions can be found in a number of places, such as:

* An Internet index such as `The Python Packages Index (PyPI)
  <http://pypi.python.org>`_, or a mirror thereof.
* Other Internet resources, such as the developer's website, or a source
  code repository such as GitHub, BitBucket, Google Code or similar.
* File systems, whether local to one computer or shared between several.
* Distributions which have already been installed, and are available in the
  ``sys.path`` of a running Python interpreter.

When we're looking for distributions, we don't always know exactly what we
want: often, we just want the latest version, but it's not uncommon to want
a specific older version, or perhaps the most recent version that meets some
constraints on the version. Since we need to be concerned with matching
versions, we need to consider the version schemes in use (see
:ref:`version-api`).

It's useful to separate the notion of a *project* from a distribution: The
project is the version-independent part of the distribution, i.e. it's
described by the *name* of the distribution and encompasses all released
distributions which use that name.

We often don't just want a single distribution, either: a common requirement,
when installing a distribution, is to locate all distributions that it relies
on, which aren't already installed. So we need a *dependency finder*, which
itself needs to locate depended-upon distributions, and recursively search for
dependencies until all that are available have been found.

We may need to distinguish between different types of dependencies:

* Post-installation dependencies. These are needed by the distribution after it
  has been installed, and is in use.
* Build dependencies. These are needed for building and/or installing the
  distribution, but are not needed by the distribution itself after
  installation.
* Test dependencies. These are only needed for testing the distribution, but
  are not needed by the distribution itself after installation.

When testing a distribution, we need all three types of dependencies. When
installing a distribution, we need the first two, but not the third.

A minimal solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Locating distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It seems that the simplest API to locate a distribution would look like
``locate(requirement)``, where ``requirement`` is a string giving the
distribution name and optional version constraints. Given that we know that
distributions can be found in different places, it's best to consider a
:class:`Locator` class which has a :meth:`locate` method with a corresponding
signature, with subclasses for each of the different types of location that
distributions inhabit. It's also reasonable to provide a default locator in
a module attribute :attr:`default_locator`, and a module-level :func:`locate`
function which calls the :meth:`locate` method on the default locator.

Since we'll often need to locate all the versions of a project before picking
one, we can imagine that a locator would need a :meth:`get_project` method for
fetching all versions of a project; and since we will be likely to want to use
caching, we can assume there will be a :meth:`_get_project` method to do the
actual work of fetching the version data, which the higher-level
:meth:`get_project` will call (and probably cache). So our locator base class
will look something like this::

    class Locator(object):
        """
        Locate distributions.
        """

        def __init__(self, version_scheme='default'):
            """
            Initialise a locator with the specified version scheme.
            """

        def locate(self, requirement):
            """
            Locate the highest-version distribution which satisfies
            the constraints in ``requirement``, and return a
            ``Distribution`` instance if found, or else ``None``.
            """

        def get_project(self, name):
            """
            Return all known distributions for a project named ``name``,
            returning a dictionary mapping version to ``Distribution``
            instance, or an empty dictionary if nothing was found.
            Use _get_project to do the actual work, and cache the results for
            future use.
            """

        def _get_project(self, name):
            """
            Return all known distributions for a project named ``name``,
            returning a dictionary mapping version to ``Distribution``
            instance, or an empty dictionary if nothing was found.
            """

When attempting to :meth:`locate`, it would be useful to pass requirement
information to :meth:`get_project` / :meth:`_get_project`. This can be done in
a :attr:`matcher` attribute which is normally ``None`` but set to a
:class:`distlib.version.Matcher` instance when a :meth:`locate` call is in
progress.


Finding dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A dependency finder will depend on a locator to locate dependencies. A simple
approach will be to consider a :class:`DependencyFinder` class which takes a
locator as a constructor argument. It might look something like this::

    class DependencyFinder(object):
        """
        Locate dependencies for distributions.
        """

        def __init__(self, locator):
            """
            Initialise an instance, using the specified locator
            to locate distributions.
            """

        def find(self, requirement, meta_extras=None, prereleases=False):
            """
            Find a distribution matching requirement and all distributions
            it depends on. Use the ``meta_extras`` argument to determine
            whether distributions used only for build, test etc. should be
            included in the results. Allow ``requirement`` to be either a
            :class:`Distribution` instance or a string expressing a
            requirement. If ``prereleases`` is True, treat pre-releases as
            normal releases; otherwise only return pre-releases if they're
            all that's available.

            Return a set of :class:`Distribution` instances and a set of
            problems.

            The distributions returned should be such that they have the
            :attr:`required` attribute set to ``True`` if they were
            from the ``requirement`` passed to ``find()``, and they have the
            :attr:`build_time_dependency` attribute set to ``True`` unless they
            are post-installation dependencies of the ``requirement``.

            The problems should be a tuple consisting of the string
            ``'unsatisfied'`` and the requirement which couldn't be satisfied
            by any distribution known to the locator.
            """


The ``index`` API
-----------------

This section describes the design of the ``distlib`` API relating to performing
certain operations on Python package indexes like PyPI. Note that this API
does not support *finding* distributions - the ``locators`` API is used for
that.

The problem we're trying to solve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Operations on a package index that are commonly performed by distribution
developers are:

* Register projects on the index.
* Upload distributions relating to projects on the index, with support for
  signed distributions.
* Upload documentation relating to projects.

Less common operations are:

* Find a list of hosts which mirror the index.
* Save a default .pypirc file with default username and password to use.

A minimal solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The distutils approach was to have several separate command classes called
``register``, ``upload`` and ``upload_doc``, where really all that was needed
was some methods. That's the approach ``distlib`` takes, by implementing a
:class:`PackageIndex` class with :meth:`register`, :meth:`upload_file` and
:meth:`upload_documentation` methods. The :class:`PackageIndex` class contains
no user interface code whatsoever: that's assumed to be the domain of the
packaging tool. The packaging tool is expected to get the required information
from a user using whatever means the developers of that tool deem to be the
most appropriate; the required attributes are then set on the
:class:`PackageIndex` instance. (Examples of this kind of information: user
name, password, whether the user wants to save a default configuration, where
the signing program and its keys live.)

The minimal interface to provide the required functionality thus looks like
this::

    class PackageIndex(object):
        def __init__(self, url=None, mirror_host=None):
            """
            Initialise an instance using a specific index URL, and
            a DNS name for a mirror host which can be used to
            determine available mirror hosts for the index.
            """

        def save_configuration(self):
            """
            Save the username and password attributes of this
            instance in a default .pypirc file.
            """
        def register(self, metadata):
            """
            Register a project on the index, using the specified metadata.
            """

        def upload_file(self, metadata, filename, signer=None,
                        sign_password=None, filetype='sdist',
                        pyversion='source'):
            """
            Upload a distribution file to the index using the
            specified metadata to identify it, with options
            for signing and for binary distributions which are
            specific to Python versions.
            """

        def upload_documentation(self, metadata, doc_dir):
            """
            Upload documentation files in a specified directory
            using the specified metadata to identify it, after
            archiving the directory contents into a .zip file.
            """

The following additional attributes can be identified on :class:`PackageIndex`
instances:

* ``username`` - the username to use for authentication.
* ``password`` - the password to use for authentication.
* ``mirrors`` (read-only) - a list of hostnames of known mirrors.


The ``resources`` API
---------------------

This section describes the design of the ``distlib`` API relating to accessing
'resources', which is a convenient label for data files associated with Python
packages.

The problem we're trying to solve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Developers often have a need to co-locate data files with their Python
packages. Examples of these might be:

* Templates, commonly used in web applications
* Translated messages used in internationalisation/localisation

The stdlib does not provide a uniform API to access these resources. A common
approach is to use ``__file__`` like this::

    base = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    data_filename = os.path.join(base, 'data.bin')
    with open(data_filename, 'rb') as f:
        # read the data from f

However, this approach fails if the package is deployed in a .zip file.

To consider how to provide a minimal uniform API to access resources in Python
packages, we'll assume that the requirements are as follows:

* All resources are regarded as binary. The consuming application is expected to
  know how to convert resources to text, where appropriate.
* All resources are read-only.
* It should be possible to access resources either as streams, or as their
  entire data as a byte-string.
* Resources will have a unique, identifying name which is text. Resources will
  be hierarchical and named using filesystem-like paths using '/' as a
  separator. The library will be responsible for converting resource names
  to the names of the underlying representations (e.g. encoding of file names
  corresponding to resource names).
* Some resources are containers of other resources, some are not. For
  example, a resource ``nested/nested_resource.bin`` in a package would not
  contain other resources, but implies the existence of a resource
  ``nested``, which contains ``nested_resource.bin``.
* Resources can only be associated with packages, not with modules. That's
  because with peer modules ``a.py`` and ``b.py``, there's no obvious location
  for data associated only with ``a``: both ``a`` and ``b`` are in the same
  directory. With a package, there's no ambiguity, as a package is associated
  with a specific directory, and no other package can be associated with that
  directory.
* Support should be provided for access to data deployed in the file system or
  in packages contained in .zip files, and third parties should be able to
  extend the facilities to work with other storage formats which support import
  of Python packages.
* It should be possible to access the contents of any resource through a
  file on the file system. This is to cater for any external APIs which need to
  access the resource data as files (examples would be a shared library for
  linking using ``dlopen()`` on POSIX, or any APIs which need access to
  resource data via OS-level file handles rather than Python streams).

A minimal solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We know that we will have to deal with resources, so it seems natural that
there would be a ``Resource`` class in the solution. From the requirements, we
can see that a ``Resource`` would have the following:

* A ``name`` property identifying the resource.
* A ``as_stream`` method allowing access to the resource data as a binary
  stream. This is not a property, because a new stream is returned each time
  this method is called. The returned stream should be closed by the caller.
* A ``bytes`` property returning the entire contents of the resource as a byte
  string.
* A ``size`` property indicating the size of the resource (in bytes).
* An ``is_container`` property indicating whether the resource is a container
  of other resources.
* A ``resources`` property returning the names of resources contained within
  the resource.

The ``Resource`` class would be the logical place to perform sanity checks
which relate to all resources. For example:

* It doesn't make sense to ask for the ``bytes`` or ``size`` properties or call
  the ``as_stream`` method of a container resource.
* It doesn't make sense to ask for the ``resources`` property of a resource
  which is *not* a container.

It seems reasonable to raise exceptions for incorrect property or method
accesses.

We know that we need to support resource access in the file system as well as
.zip files, and to support other sources of storage which might be used to
import Python packages. Since import and loading of Python packages happens
through :pep:`302` importers and loaders, we can deduce that the mechanism used
to find resources in a package will be closely tied to the loader for that
package.

We could consider an API for finding resources in a package like this::

    def find_resource(pkg, resource_name):
        # return a Resource instance for the resource

and then use it like this::

    r1 = find_resource(pkg, 'foo')
    r2 = find_resource(pkg, 'bar')

However, we'll often have situations where we will want to get multiple
resources from a package, and in certain applications we might want to
implement caching or other processing of resources before returning them.
The above API doesn't facilitate this, so let's consider delegating the finding
of resources in a package to a *finder* for that package. Once we get a finder,
we can hang on to it and ask it to find multiple resources. Finders
can be extended to provide whatever caching and preprocessing an application
might need.

To get a finder for a package, let's assume there's a ``finder`` function::

    def finder(pkg):
        # return a finder for the specified package

We can use it like this::

    f = finder(pkg)
    r1 = f.find('foo')
    r2 = f.find('bar')

The ``finder`` function knows what kind of finder to return for a particular
package through the use of a registry. Given a package, ``finder`` can
determine the loader for that package, and based on the type of loader, it can
instantiate the right kind of finder. The registry maps loader types to
callables that return finders. The callable is called with a single
argument -- the Python module object for the package.

Given that we have finders in the design, we can identify
``ResourceFinder`` and ``ZipResourceFinder`` classes for the two import
systems we're going to support. We'll make ``ResourceFinder`` a concrete
class rather than an interface - it'll implement getting resources from
packages stored in the file system. ``ZipResourceFinder`` will be a
subclass of ``ResourceFinder``.

Since there is no loader for file system packages when the C-based import
system is used, the registry will come with the following mappings:

* ``type(None)`` -> ``ResourceFinder``
* ``_frozen_importlib.SourceFileLoader -> ``ResourceFinder``
* ``zipimport.zipimporter`` -> ``ZipResourceFinder``

Users of the API can add new or override existing mappings using the following
function::

    def register_finder(loader, finder_maker):
        # register ``finder_maker`` to make finders for packages with a loader
        # of the same type as ``loader``.

Typically, the ``finder_maker`` will be a class like ``ResourceFinder`` or
``ZipResourceFinder``, but it can be any callable which takes the Python module
object for a package and returns a finder.

Let's consider in more detail what finders look like and how they interact with
the ``Resource`` class. We'll keep the Resource class minimal; API users never
instantiate ``Resource`` directly, but call a finder's ``find`` method to
return a ``Resource`` instance. A finder could return an instance of a
``Resource`` subclass if really needed, though it shouldn't be necessary in
most cases. If a finder can't find a resource, it should return ``None``.

The Resource constructor will look like this::

    def __init__(self, finder, name):
        self.finder = finder
        self.name = name
        # other initialisation, not specified

and delegate as much work as possible to its finder. That way, new import
loader types can be supported just by implementing a suitable
``XXXResourceFinder`` for that loader type.

What a finder needs to do can be exemplified by the following skeleton for
``ResourceFinder``::

    class ResourceFinder(object):
        def __init__(self, module):
            "Initialise finder for the specified package"

        def find(self, resource_name):
            "Find and return a ``Resource`` instance or ``None``"

        def is_container(self, resource):
            "Return whether resource is a container"

        def get_bytes(self, resource):
            "Return the resource's data as bytes"

        def get_size(self, resource):
            "Return the size of the resource's data in bytes"

        def get_stream(self, resource):
            "Return the resource's data as a binary stream"

        def get_resources(self, resource):
            """
            Return the resources contained in this resource as a set of
            (relative) resource names
            """

Dealing with the requirement for access via file system files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To cater for the requirement that the contents of some resources be made
available via a file on the file system, we'll assume a simple caching
solution that saves any such resources to a local file system cache, and
returns the filename of the resource in the cache. We need to divide the
work between the finder and the cache. We'll deliver the cache function
through a :class:`Cache` class, which will have the following methods:

* A constructor which takes an optional base directory for the cache. If
  none is provided, we'll construct a base directory of the form::

     <rootdir>/.distlib/resource-cache

  where ``<rootdir>`` is the user's home directory. On Windows, if the
  environment specifies a variable named ``LOCALAPPDATA``, its value
  will be used as ``<rootdir>`` -- otherwise, the user's home directory
  will be used.

* A :meth:`get` method which takes a ``Resource`` and returns a file system
  filename, such that the contents of that named file will be the contents
  of the resource.

* An :meth:`is_stale` method which takes a ``Resource`` and its corresponding
  file system filename, and returns whether the file system file is stale
  when compared with the resource. Knowing that cache invalidation is hard,
  the default implementation just returns ``True``.

* A :meth:`prefix_to_dir` method which converts a prefix to a directory name.
  We'll assume that for the cache, a resource path can be divided into two
  parts: the *prefix* and the *subpath*. For resources in a .zip file, the
  prefix would be the pathname of the archive, while the subpath would be the
  path inside the archive. For a file system resource, since it is already in
  the file system, the prefix would be ``None`` and the subpath would be the
  absolute path name of the resource. The :meth:`prefix_to_dir` method's job
  is to convert a prefix (if not ``None``) to a subdirectory in the cache
  that holds the cached files for all resources with that prefix. We'll
  delegate the determination of a resource's prefix and subpath to its finder,
  using a :meth:`get_cache_info` method on finders, which takes a ``Resource``
  and returns a (``prefix``, ``subpath``) tuple.

  The default implementation will use :func:`os.splitdrive` to see if there's
  a Windows drive, if present, and convert its ``':'`` to ``'---'``. The rest
  of the prefix will be converted by replacing ``'/'`` by ``'--'``, and
  appending ``'.cache'`` to the result.

The cache will be activated when the ``file_path`` property of a ``Resource``
is accessed. This will be a cached property, and will call the cache's
:meth:`get` method to obtain the file system path.

The ``scripts`` API
-------------------

This section describes the design of the ``distlib`` API relating to installing
scripts.

The problem we're trying to solve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing scripts is slightly more involved than simply copying files from
source to target, for the following reasons:

* On POSIX systems, scripts need to be made executable. To cater for scenarios
  where there are multiple Python versions installed on a computer, scripts
  need to have their shebang lines adjusted to point to the correct
  interpreter. This requirement is commonly found when virtual environments
  (venvs) are in use, but also in other multiple-interpreter scenarios.
* On Windows systems, which don't support shebang lines natively, some
  alternate means of finding the correct interpreter need to be provided.
  Following the acceptance and implementation of PEP 397, a shebang-
  interpreting launcher will be available in Python 3.3 and later and a
  standalone version of it for use with earlier Python versions is also
  available. However, where this can't be used, an alternative approach
  using executable launchers installed with the scripts may be necessary.
  (That is the approach taken by ``setuptools``.)
  Windows also has two types of launchers - console applications and
  Windows applications. The appropriate launcher needs to be used for
  scripts.
* Some scripts are effectively just callable code in a Python package,
  with boilerplate for importing that code, calling it and returning
  its return value as the script's return code. It would be useful to
  have the boilerplate standardised, so that developers need just specify
  which callables to expose as scripts, and under what names, using e.g. a
  ``name = callable`` syntax. (This is the approach taken by ``setuptools``
  for the popular ``console_scripts`` feature).

A minimal solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. currentmodule:: distlib.scripts

Script handling in ``distutils`` and ``setuptools`` is done in two phases:
'build' and 'install'. Whether a particular packaging tool chooses to do
the 'heavy lifting' of script creation (i.e. the things referred to
above, beyond simple copying) in 'build' or 'install' phases, the job is
the same. To abstract out just the functionality relating to scripts,
in an extensible way, we can just delegate the work to a class,
unimaginatively called :class:`~distlib.scripts.ScriptMaker`. Given the
above requirements, together with the more basic requirement of being able
to do 'dry-run' installation, we need to provide a ``ScriptMaker`` with the
following items of information:

* Where source scripts are to be found.
* Where scripts are to be installed.
* Whether, on Windows, executable launchers should be added.
* Whether a dry-run mode is in effect.

These dictate the form that :meth:`ScriptMaker.__init__`
will take.

In addition, other methods suggest themselves for :class:`ScriptMaker`:

* A :meth:`~ScriptMaker.make` method, which takes a *specification*, which is
  either a filename or a 'wrap me a callable' indicator which looks
  like this::

      name = some_package.some_module:some_callable [ flag(=value) ... ]

  The ``name`` would need to be a valid filename for a script, and the
  ``some_package.some_module`` part would indicate the module where the
  callable resides. The ``some_callable`` part identifies the callable,
  and optionally you can have flags, which the :class:`ScriptMaker` instance
  must know how to interpret. One flag would be ``'gui'``, indicating that
  the launcher should be a Windows application rather than a console
  application, for GUI-based scripts which shouldn't show a console window.

  The above specification is used by ``setuptools`` for the 'console_scripts'
  feature.  See :ref:`flag-formats` for more information about flags.

  .. note:: Both ``setuptools`` and :pep:`426` interpret flags as a single
     value, which represents an extra (a set of optional dependencies needed
     for optional features of a distribution).

  It seems sensible for this method to return a list of absolute paths of
  files that were installed (or would have been installed, but for the
  dry-run mode being in effect).

* A :meth:`~ScriptMaker.make_multiple` method, which takes an iterable of
  specifications and just runs calls :meth:`~ScriptMaker.make` on each
  item iterated over, aggregating the results to return a list of absolute paths
  of all files that were installed (or would have been installed, but for the
  dry-run mode being in effect).

  One advantage of having this method is that you can override it in a
  subclass for post-processing, e.g. to run a tool like ``2to3``, or an
  analysis tool, over all the installed files.

* The details of the callable specification can be encapsulated in a utility
  function, :func:`~distlib.util.get_exports_entry`. This would take a
  specification and return ``None``, if the specification didn't match the
  callable format, or an instance of :class:`ExportEntry` if it did match.

In addition, the following attributes on a ``ScriptMaker`` could be further used
to refine its behaviour:

* ``force`` to indicate when scripts should be copied from source to target
  even when timestamps show the target is up to date.
* ``set_mode`` to indicate whether, on Posix, the execute mode bits should be
  set on the target script.

.. _flag-formats:

Flag formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flags, if present, are enclosed by square brackets. Each flag can have the
format of just an alphanumeric string, optionally followed by an '=' and a
value (with no intervening spaces). Multiple flags can be separated by ','
and whitespace. The following would be valid flag sections::

   [a,b,c]
   [a, b, c]
   [a=b, c=d, e, f=g, 9=8]

whereas the following would be invalid::

  []
  [\]
  [a,]
  [a,,b]
  [a=,b,c]

.. note:: Both ``setuptools`` and :pep:`426` restrict flag formats to a single
   value, without an ``=``. This value represents an extra (a set of optional
   dependencies needed for optional features of a distribution).

.. _version-api:

The ``version`` API
-------------------

This section describes the design of the ``distlib`` API relating to versions.

The problem we're trying to solve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distribution releases are named by versions and versions have two principal
uses:

* Identifying a particular release and determining whether or not it is
  earlier or later than some other release.

* When specifying other distributions that a distribution release depends on,
  specifying constraints governing the releases of those distributions that are
  depended upon.

In addition, qualitative information may be given by the version format about
the quality of the release: e.g. alpha versions, beta versions, stable
releases, hot-fixes following a stable release. The following excerpt from
:pep:`386` defines the requirements for versions:

* It should be possible to express more than one versioning level (usually this
  is expressed as major and minor revision and, sometimes, also a micro
  revision).
* A significant number of projects need special meaning versions for
  "pre-releases" (such as "alpha", "beta", "rc"), and these have widely used
  aliases ("a" stands for "alpha", "b" for "beta" and "c" for "rc"). And these
  pre-release versions make it impossible to use a simple alphanumerical
  ordering of the version string components. (e.g. 3.1a1 < 3.1)
* Some projects also need "post-releases" of regular versions, mainly for
  maintenance purposes, which can't be clearly expressed otherwise.
* Development versions allow packagers of unreleased work to avoid version
  clashes with later stable releases.

There are a number of version schemes in use. The ones of most interest in the
Python ecosystem are:

* Loose versioning in ``distutils``. *Any* version number is allowed, with
  lexicographical ordering. No support exists for pre- and post-releases,
  and lexicographical ordering can be unintuitive (e.g. '1.10' < '1.2.1')

* Strict versioning in ``distutils``, which supports slightly more
  structure. It allows for up to three dot-separated numeric components, and
  support for multiple alpha and beta releases. However, there is no support
  for release candidates, nor for post-release versions.

* Versioning in ``setuptools``/``distribute``. This is described in
  :pep:`386` in
  `this section <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/#setuptools>`_ --
  it's perhaps the most widely used Python version scheme, but since it tries
  to be very flexible and work with a wide range of conventions, it ends up
  allowing a very chaotic mess of version conventions in the Python community
  as a whole.

* The proposed versioning scheme described in :pep:`440`.

* `Semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_, which is rational, simple and
  well-regarded in the software community in general.

Although the new versioning scheme mentioned in PEP 386 was implemented in
``distutils2`` and that code has been copied over to ``distlib``, there are
many projects on PyPI which do not conform to it, but rather to the "legacy"
versioning schemes in ``distutils``/``setuptools``/``distribute``. These
schemes are deserving of some support not because of their intrinsic qualities,
but due to their ubiquity in projects registered on PyPI. Below are some
results from testing actual projects on PyPI::

   Packages processed: 24891
   Packages with no versions: 217
   Packages with versions: 24674
   Number of packages clean for all schemes: 19010 (77%)
   Number of packages clean for PEP 386: 21072 (85%)
   Number of packages clean for PEP 386 + suggestion: 23685 (96%)
   Number of packages clean for legacy: 24674 (100%, by you would expect)
   Number of packages clean for semantic: 19278 (78%)

where "+ suggestion" refers to using the suggested version algorithm to derive
a version from a version which would otherwise be incompatible with :pep:`386`.

A minimal solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. currentmodule:: distlib.version

Since ``distlib`` is a low-level library which might be used by tools which
work with existing projects, the internal implementation of versions has
changed slightly from ``distutils2`` to allow better support for legacy
version numbering. Since the re-implementation facilitated adding semantic
version support at minimal cost, this has also been provided.

Versions
~~~~~~~~

The basic scheme is as follows. The differences between versioning schemes
is catered for by having a single function for each scheme which converts
a string version to an appropriate tuple which acts as a key for sorting
and comparison of versions. We have a base class, ``Version``, which defines
any common code. Then we can have subclasses ``NormalizedVersion`` (PEP-386),
``LegacyVersion`` (``distribute``/``setuptools``) and ``SemanticVersion``.

To compare versions, we just check type compatibility and then compare the
corresponding tuples.

Matchers
~~~~~~~~

Matchers take a name followed by a set of constraints in parentheses.
Each constraint is an operation together with a version string which
needs to be converted to the corresponding version instance.

In summary, the following attributes can be identified for ``Version`` and
``Matcher``:

Version:
   - version string passed in to constructor (stripped)
   - parser to convert string string to tuple
   - compare functions to compare with other versions of same type

Matcher:
   - version string passed in to constructor (stripped)
   - name of distribution
   - list of constraints
   - parser to convert string to name and set of constraints,
     using the same function as for ``Version`` to convert the version
     strings in the constraints to version instances
   - method to match version to constraints and return True/False

Given the above, it appears that all the functionality *could* be provided
with a single class per versioning scheme, with the *only* difference
between them being the function to convert from version string to tuple.
Any instance would act as either version or predicate, would display itself
differently according to which it is, and raise exceptions if the wrong
type of operation is performed on it (matching only allowed for predicate
instances; <=, <, >=, > comparisons only allowed for version instances;
and == and != allowed for either.

However, the use of the same class to implement versions and predicates leads
to ambiguity, because of the very loose project naming and versioning schemes
allowed by PyPI. For example, "Hello 2.0" could be a valid project name, and
"5" is a project name actually registered on PyPI. If distribution names can
look like versions, it's hard to discern the developer's intent when creating
an instance with the string "5". So, we make separate classes for Version
and Matcher.

For ease of testing, the module will define, for each of the supported
schemes, a function to do the parsing (as no information is needed other than
the string), and the parse method of the class will call that function::

    def normalized_key(s):
        "parse using PEP-386 logic"

    def legacy_key(s):
        "parse using distribute/setuptools logic"

    def semantic_key(s):
        "parse using semantic versioning logic"

    class Version:
        # defines all common code

        def parse(self, s):
            raise NotImplementedError('Please implement in a subclass')

and then::

    class NormalizedVersion(Version):
        def parse(self, s): return normalized_key(s)

    class LegacyVersion(Version):
        def parse(self, s): return legacy_key(s)

    class SemanticVersion(Version):
        def parse(self, s): return semantic_key(s)

And a custom versioning scheme can be devised to work in the same way::

    def custom_key(s):
       """
       convert s to tuple using custom logic, raise UnsupportedVersionError
       on problems
       """

    class CustomVersion(Version):
        def parse(self, s): return custom_key(s)

The matcher classes are pretty minimal, too::

    class Matcher(object):
        version_class = None

        def match(self, string_or_version):
            """
            If passed a string, convert to version using version_class,
            then do matching in a way independent of version scheme in use
            """

and then::

    class NormalizedMatcher(Matcher):
        version_class = NormalizedVersion

    class LegacyMatcher(Matcher):
        version_class = LegacyVersion

    class SemanticMatcher(Matcher):
        version_class = SemanticVersion

Version schemes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ideally one would want to work with the PEP 386 scheme, but there might be times
when one needs to work with the legacy scheme (for example, when investigating
dependency graphs of existing PyPI projects). Hence, the important aspects of
each scheme are bundled into a simple :class:`VersionScheme` class::

    class VersionScheme(object):
        def __init__(self, key, matcher):
            self.key = key          # version string -> tuple converter
            self.matcher = matcher  # Matcher subclass for the scheme

Of course, the version class is also available through the matcher's
``version_class`` attribute.

:class:`VersionScheme` makes it easier to work with alternative version schemes.
For example, say we decide to experiment with an "adaptive" version scheme,
which is based on the PEP 386 scheme, but when handed a non-conforming version,
automatically tries to convert it to a normalized version using
:func:`suggest_normalized_version`. Then, code which has to deal with version
schemes just has to pick the appropriate scheme by name.

Creating the adaptive scheme is easy::

    def adaptive_key(s):
        try:
            result = normalized_key(s, False)
        except UnsupportedVersionError:
            s = suggest_normalized_version(s)
            if s is None:
                raise
            result = normalized_key(s, False)
        return result


    class AdaptiveVersion(NormalizedVersion):
        def parse(self, s): return adaptive_key(s)

    class AdaptiveMatcher(Matcher):
        version_class = AdaptiveVersion


The appropriate scheme can be fetched by using the :func:`get_scheme` function,
which is defined thus::

    def get_scheme(scheme_name):
        "Get a VersionScheme for the given scheme_name."

Allowed names are ``'normalized'``, ``'legacy'``, ``'semantic'``,
``'adaptive'`` and ``'default'`` (which points to the same as ``'adaptive'``).
If an unrecognised name is passed in, a ``ValueError`` is raised.

The reimplemented ``distlib.version`` module is shorter than the corresponding
module in ``distutils2``, but the entire test suite passes and there is support
for working with three versioning schemes as opposed to just one. However, the
concept of "final" versions, which is not in the PEP but which was in the
``distutils2`` implementation, has been removed because it appears of little
value (there's no way to determine the "final" status of versions for many of
the project releases registered on PyPI).


The ``wheel`` API
-----------------

This section describes the design of the ``wheel`` API which facilitates
building and installing from *wheels*, the new binary distribution format for
Python described in :pep:`427`.

The problem we're trying to solve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are basically two operations which need to be performed on wheels:

* Building a wheel from a source distribution.
* Installing a distribution which has been packaged as a wheel.

A minimal solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since we're talking about wheels, it seems likely that a :class:`Wheel` class
would be part of the design. This allows for extensibility over a purely
function-based API. The :class:`Wheel` would be expected to have methods that
support the required operations::

    class Wheel(object):
        def __init__(self, spec):
            """
            Initialise an instance from a specification. This can either be a
            valid filename for a wheel (for when you want to work with an
            existing wheel), or just the ``name-version-buildver`` portion of
            a wheel's filename (for when you're going to build a wheel for a
            known version and build of a named project).
            """

        def build(self, paths, tags=None):
            """
            Build a wheel. The ``name`, ``version`` and ``buildver`` should
            already have been set correctly. The ``paths`` should be a
            dictionary with keys 'prefix', 'scripts', 'headers', 'data' and one
            of 'purelib' and 'platlib'. These must point to valid paths if
            they are to be included in the wheel. The optional ``tags``
            argument should, if specified, be a dictionary with optional keys
            'pyver', 'abi' and 'arch' indicating lists of tags which
            indicate environments with which the wheel is compatible.
            """

        def install(self, paths, maker, **kwargs):
            """
            Install from a wheel. The ``paths`` should be a dictionary with
            keys 'prefix', 'scripts', 'headers', 'data', 'purelib' and
            'platlib'. These must point to valid paths to which files may
            be written if they are in the wheel. Only one of the 'purelib'
            and 'platlib' paths will be used (in the case where they are
            different), depending on whether the wheel is for a pure-
            Python distribution.

            The ``maker`` argument should be a suitably configured
            :class:`ScriptMaker` instance. The ``source_dir`` and
            ``target_dir`` arguments can be set to ``None`` when creating the
            instance - these will be set to appropriate values inside this
            method.

            The following keyword arguments are recognised:

            * ``warner``, if specified, should be a callable
              that will be called with (software_wheel_ver, file_wheel_ver)
              if they differ. They will both be in the form of tuples
              (major_ver, minor_ver). The ``warner`` defaults to ``None``.

            * It's conceivable that one might want to install only the library
              portion of a package -- not installing scripts, headers data and
              so on. If ``lib_only`` is specified as ``True``, only the
              ``site-packages`` contents will be installed. The default value
              is ``False`` (meaning everything will be installed).
            """

In addition to the above, the following attributes can be identified for a
:class:`Wheel` instance:

* ``name`` -- the name of the distribution
* ``version`` -- the version of the distribution
* ``buildver`` -- the build tag for the distribution
* ``pyver`` -- a list of Python versions with which the wheel is compatible
* ``abi`` -- a list of application binary interfaces (ABIs) with which the
  wheel is compatible
* ``arch`` -- a list of architectures with which the wheel is compatible
* ``dirname`` -- The directory in which a wheel file is found/to be
  created
* ``filename`` -- The filename of the wheel (computed from the other
  attributes)
